The Shows page has become self-aware!

Through some particularly monstrous spaghetti code of my own devilish creation, the Shows page now pulls from The Bandâ„¢s very own Google Calendar, meaning you should now all have just as up-to-date information about upcoming shows as we do!

(provided you check [_here_](https://blackmarketgarden.com/shows) for that information, of course...)
