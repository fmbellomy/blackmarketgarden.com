Very exciting news BMG fans- you can now join our official Discord server and observe as our statuses change from offline to online at various points throughout the day.

It is a great place to enjoy your beverage of choice. Certainly.

It is also- more importantly- a reliable way to stay up to date on future shows for the band- actually updating the shows listing on this page is something I admittedly forget to do somewhat regularly. It is much easier for us to inform you of our plans on Discord than through this website.

For those of you who dare to join: you can do so by clicking the Discord logo at the top of _this very website._
